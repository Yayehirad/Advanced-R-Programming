```{r}
# Install swirl
install.packages("swirl")
packageVersion("swirl")
library(swirl)
#Install the R Programming Environment course
install_course("Advanced R Programming")
swirl()
```
When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!
